## Installation
https://dlthub.com/docs/reference/installation
The guide there uses pip rather than a pyproject.toml, which needs to be activated in your terminal with `source .venv/bin/activate`. If I encounter problems with this, I will switch to pyproject.toml

## Learning steps
I intend to follow the following tutorials today:

- [Load data from Pure Python data structures](https://dlthub.com/docs/tutorial/load-data-from-an-api)
- [Load data from a REST API](https://dlthub.com/docs/tutorial/rest-api)
- [Load data from a SQL database](https://dlthub.com/docs/tutorial/sql-database)
- [Load data from a cloud storage or a file system](https://dlthub.com/docs/tutorial/filesystem)
